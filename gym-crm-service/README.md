T# Gym CRM — Spring Security Module

This project builds on the existing Gym CRM Spring Boot application by adding full authentication and authorization using 
Spring Security and JWT.

## Module Highlights

- Username/password authentication for protected endpoints
- Password hashing with salt
- JWT-based token authorization for login and registration
- Brute-force protection (temporary user blocking)
- Secure logout
- CORS configuration

Each feature is implemented step-by-step, with unit tests, clean commits, and best practices.
